# SeqTransfer
A novel sequential transfer scheme with a path selection strategy for medical image analysis.

· We propose a task affinity metric tailored for medical images, which assesses the relatedness among tasks.


Considering the characteristics of medical image segmentation tasks, we analyze the image and label similarity between tasks and compute the task affinity scores.

Run task_affinity_estimation.py to calculate the task affinity between task i and task j.

ICA.py is for the image characteristics similarity estimation.

OCA.py is for the object characteristics similarity estimation.
